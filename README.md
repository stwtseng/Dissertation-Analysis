# Description

This repository contains a record of the analyses I conducted for my dissertation research. The code and output of all analyses were compiled into the R Notebook file ("dis_analysis_compiled.nb.html") using RMarkdown ("dis_analysis_compiled.Rmd").

The published dissertation is available online through OhioLINK and can be accessed [using this link](http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=akron1590497329605876).

The raw data from this research is not provided for confidentiality.

The summarySE function was borrowed from [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Manipulating_data/Summarizing_data/) and the corstars function was borrowed from [Dominik Vogel's page](https://github.com/DominikVogel/vogelR/).
